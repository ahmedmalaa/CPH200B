    "\n",
    "The dataset we will use in this task was extracted from the electronic health records (EHRs) of 299 heart failure patients from the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and at the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad (Punjab, Pakistan), during April–December 2015. The cohort included 105 women and 194 men, and their ages range between 40 and 95 years old. All 299 patients had left ventricular systolic dysfunction and had previous heart failures (HF) that put them in classes III or IV of New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of the stages of heart failure. The dataset contains 13 features, which report clinical, body, and lifestyle information. The patients were followed up for 130 days on average (maximum follow-up period was 285 days). The event of interest was death during the follow-up period. "

    "#### Clinical background\n",
    "\n",
    "Heart transplantation is a critical surgical intervention designed to save lives by replacing a patient's diseased heart with a healthy one obtained from a deceased donor. This procedure is typically considered when no other viable medical or surgical alternatives exist for the patient. The majority of heart transplantations are performed on individuals facing \"end-stage\" heart failure. \"End-stage\" refers to a condition that has progressed to such an advanced state that all available treatments, except for a heart transplant, have proven ineffective. Due to the scarcity of donor hearts, individuals in need of a heart transplant undergo a meticulous selection process at specialized heart transplant centers. Those deemed eligible are then placed on a waiting list, underscoring the critical importance of timely organ availability in this life-saving procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Setup and Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, we will use data collected by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) [2], a non-profit organization that administers the only Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) in the US. UNOS is involved in many aspects of the organ transplant and donation process in the US, including data collection and maintenance, providing assitance to patients and care takers, and informing policy makers on the best use of the limited supply of organs and give all patients a fair chance at receiving the organ they need. UNOS manages the heart transplant waiting list, i.e., the list of terminally-ill patients waiting for donor heart. In order to determine the order of priority for receipt of a donor heart, individuals are classified by degrees of severity for a donor heart, blood type, body weight, and geographic location.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Task will focus on the cohort of terminally-ill patients who are enrolled in the wait-list for heart transplantation. In this setup, our goal is to predict the patients who are less likely to survive in order to prioritize them for receiving donated organs. The UNOS data covers 30 years of heart transplantation data in the US, spanning the years from 1985 to 2015. We will use data for patients who were on the wait-list for heart transplantation in the US from 1985 to 2010 (27,926 patients) to train an ML-based model for predicting individual-level survival. A held-out test set of 8,403 patients enrolled in the wait-list between 2010 and 2015 will be used by the instructor to evaluate your model. You can load the UNOS data in pandas as follows."

    "- \"hgt_cm_tcr\": Patient's height in cm\n",
    "- \"wgt_kg_tcr\": Patient's weight in kgs\n",

    "- \"ventilator_tcr\": Indication on whether the patient was dependent on a ventilator at time of enrollment in the wait-list\n",
    "- \"ecmo_tcr\": Indication on whether the patient was treated with ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) by the time they where enrolled in the wait-list. ECMO is an artificial life support that continuously pumps blood out of the patient's body and sends it through a series of devices that add oxygen and remove carbon dioxide, pumping the blood back to the patient. It is used for a patient whose heart and lungs are not functioning properly.  \n",
    "- \"most_rcnt_creat\": Creatinine level in the patient's most recent blood test before enrolling in wait-list.\n",
    "- \"vad_while_listed\": Whether the patient was on ventricular assist device (VAD) support when listed for a heart transplant. VAD is a mechanical pump used to restore cardiac function by pumping blood from the lower chambers of the heart to the rest of the body.\n",
    "- \"iabp_tcr\": Whether the patient was on Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) Therapy. This is a therapeutic device used to improve blood flow when the heart is unable to pump enough blood for your body.\n",
    "- \"init_bmi_calc\": Patient's Body Mass Index at time of enrollment in the wait-list.\n",
    "- \"tah\": Whether the patient underwent a total artificial heart (TAH) surgery. This is a mechanical pump that replaces the heart when it is not working as it should.\n",
    "- \"inotropic\": Whether the patient was on an Inotropic drug at time of enrollment in wait-list. These are medicines that change the force of the heart's contractions.\n",
    "- \"days_stat1\", \"days_stat1a\", \"days_stat1b\", \"days_stat2\": UNOS has an internal system for classifying the priority of patients for receiving a heart transplant. Individuals classified as Status 1A have the highest priority on the heart transplant waiting list. Status 1A are individuals who must stay in the hospital as in-patients and require high doses of intravenous drugs, require a VAD for survival, are dependent on a ventilator or have a life expectancy of a week or less without a transplant. Individuals classified as Status 1B are generally not required to stay in the hospital as in-patients. All other candidates for the transplant are listed under Status 2. These variables indicate the number of days a patient spends in each status during the time between their enrollment in the wait-list and death or reception of a transplant.\n",
